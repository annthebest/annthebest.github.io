  <h1>About me!</h1>
  
  <h3> Basic info </h3>
  <p> My name is Ann Efrina, people usually call me <strong>Ann</strong>. <br>
    I am currently studying in Woodgrove Secondary School and will be graduating <em>this year</em>. <br>
    I would say I am quite shy but I actually have <em>a lot</em> on my mind. <br>
    Learning new things is a hobby of mine. <br>
    I have learnt how to code, solve a rubix cube, play the piano, trombone and trumpet <span>(I am quite passionate about music)</span> and I would like to learn many more things in the <em>near future</em>. <br>
    One fun fact about me is that I absolutely adore cats. I even have a cat <em>myself!</em> <br>
    Her name is Boo and she is my <em>best friend</em>.
    
  <h3> School life </h3>
     <p> I have quite a demanding subject combination but I would say I am coping quite well. However, I think the reason that is the case is due to support of my family, teachers and peers. Without them, it'd be hard for me to cope as well as I am now. As I have mentioned before, I am quite passionate about music. Thus, I joined Symphonic Band and met many new friends there.

      <h3> Friends </h3>
  <p> Speaking of friends, my friends play quite a big role in my life and even so, I have kept in touch with my primary school friends. With that, I have learnt so much from them and they have shaped me to become the person I am today.
  <ul> Here are some things I have learnt from them </ul>
  <li> We should appreciate the finer things in life </li>
  <li> The best things in life are free </li>
  <li> We should not take things for granted </li>
  
  <p><h4> That draws the end to my personal website. This isn't the end! </h4> </p>
